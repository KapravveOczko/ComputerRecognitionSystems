<TITLE>SEC DETAILS CHARGES AGAINST JEFFERIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Federal regulators said Boyd
Jefferies, who resigned as head of his Los Angeles brokerage
firm, took part in schemes to manipulate the price of a stock
and in a stock "parking" plot with inside trader Ivan Boesky.
    In a civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in New
York, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Jefferies
agreed with an unidentified person to have his firm buy up a
large chunk of stock being issued in a public offering.
    Under the agreement, the firm, Jefferies and Co, drove the
price of the stock up by one-eighth point by buying four blocks
of the stock at or near the close of trading, the SEC said.
    Jefferies and Co's purchases of the unidentified stock
accounted for 66 pct of the total trading volume of the stock
on that day and were aimed at manipulation, the SEC said.
    The complaint did not identify the company whose stock was
being traded, but said that the Jefferies and Co purchases took
place sometime last year when another unidentified company,
which owned a controlling interest in the company, sold several
million shares of the stock in a secondary public offering.
    The stock purchases were made on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange, the SEC said.
    The person who made the alleged stock manipulation
agreement with Jefferies was also not identified.
    But the person was later billed by Jefferies and Co in a
phony invoice marked for investment banking services for the
exact amount the firm lost on the deal when it later sold the
stock on the open market, the SEC said.
    The payment, the amount of which was also not revealed in
the complaint, was made later by another unidentified person
after Jefferies sent a second invoice for a lesser amount, the
SEC said. The firm recorded the payment as "other income," it
said.
    William McLucas, associate director of enforcement at the
SEC, declined to say why the agency decided against revealing
the identities of other persons and companies involved in the
stock manipulation scheme.
    "We just made a determination that this was the way to go
at this time," McLucas told Reuters.
    The complaint went into far greater detail in its charges
that Jefferies agreed with Boesky to "park" stock at each
other's firms. Parking, or warehousing, stock, refers to deals
where stock is held by one person or firm under an arrangement
where it is actually under the control of someone else.
    Under the agreement between Jefferies and Boesky, Jefferies
and Co would hold stock owned by Seemala Corp, one of Boesky's
brokerage firms, for 31 days, after which Seemala would "buy"
the stock back, the SEC said.
    Seemala realized all gains and sustained all losses on the
stock held by Jefferies and Co during the period, agreed to
compensate Jefferies and Co for carrying the stock and to pay
more than twice Jefferies and Co's usual commission, it said.
    Seemala then agreed to hold stock owned by Jefferies and Co
for a month under terms about the same as the deal in which
Seemala agreed to park its stock at Jefferies and Co, it said.
    The agreement, which violated several securities laws,
allowed Seemala to create a false appearance that no longer
held the stock and could meet the SEC's net capital
requirements, the SEC said.
    Jefferies wanted Seemala to hold some of its stock, the SEC
said, so that Jefferies and Co could meet its net capital
needs, the agency said.
    On March 12, 1985, Seemala "sold" Jefferies 810,000 shares
oc Cooper Laboratories Inc for 11.7 mln dlrs, 600,000 shares of
Southland Financial Corp for 17.3 mln dlrs and 500,000 shares
of G.D. Searle and Co for 27.1 mln dlrs, it said.
    On March 20, Jefferies and Co "sold" Seemala 185,500 shares
of American Broadcasting Co for 19.6 mln dlrs, 210,000 shares
of Ideal Basic Industries Inc for 2.9 mln dlrs, 300,000 shares
of ITT Corp for 9.8 mln dlrs, 105,000 shares of Phillips
Petroleum Co for 4.0 mln dlrs, 70,000 shares of Pioneer Corp
for 2.1 mln dlrs and 300,000 shares of Texas Oil and Gas Corp
for 5.3 mln dlrs, the SEC said.
    The value of Seemala's stock at the time of the transfers
was 56 mln dlrs, while Jefferies and Co's stock was worth 43
mln dlrs at the time, the SEC said.
    Within a month, Seemala and Jefferies and Co unwound most
of the stock transfers with each others firms, the SEC said.
    But a major hitch developed in the deal when the price of
Searle stock, which Jefferies and Co was holding for Seemala,
dipped sharply, it said.
    On March 26 Seemala "bought" back its Searle stock for 23.4
mln dlrs, resulting in a 3.6 mln dlr loss for Jefferies and Co,
the SEC said. Seemala then allowed Jefferies and Co to "buy"
back some it the stock Seemala was holding for it at a 647,812
dlr gain and Boesky's firms later paid the Jefferies firm three
mln dlrs, which it called "fees," it said.
    Among the violations Jefferies committed in the schemes,
were net capital, record keeping, public disclosure and margin
requirements, the SEC said.
    Under the settlement of the civil SEC's charges, which was
announced simultaneously with the filing of the complaint,
Jefferies and his firm did not have to admit or deny guilt.
    But they agreed to a court order barring them from further
securities law violations.
    Jefferies also agreed to get out of the securities business
for at least five years.

<TITLE>MERRILL LYNCH &lt;MER> DEBT DOWNGRADED BY MOODY'S</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 119 - </DATELINE><BODY>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
downgraded the ratings on six billion dlrs of debt of Merrill
Lynch and Co Inc.
    Cut were the firm's senior debt, Eurodebt and senior
guaranteed Eurodebt to A-1 from Aa-3 and subordinated debt to
A-2 from A-1.
    Merrill's Prime-1 commercial paper was not under review.
    Moody's said that while Merrill's absolute earnings would
continue to increase, the house's profitability will lag that
of its peers. And Merrill's attempts to improve profitability
will be constrained by accelerating competition, Moody's said.
    Moody's also said Merrill Lynch would continue to
aggressively commit its capital to such merchant banking
activities as bridge financing.
    "These activities elevate the risk content of Merrill's
balance sheet at the same time as low profitability inhibits
the strong internal capital generation which may be necessary
to support business expansion efforts," Moody's said.
    The rating agency noted, however, that Merrill's franchise
retains significant value and gives the firm strong proprietary
securities placement power.

<TITLE>SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Secretary of State George Shultz has
decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
    "Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
they want to do," the official said.
    If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
Soviet Union, he said, "Shultz will not wage a vigorous
campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
he won't go to the President and voice his objections."
    In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
Growers, the State Department said, "Secretary Shultz expressed
his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
    The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
Program."
    Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
Moscow, the State Department official said.
    "Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."
    USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
    The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
    The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
State Department source said.
    "What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
lowest price being paid by anyone in the world," he said.
    The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
    Government and commodity sources also said there are
elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
    "Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
foregone conclusion," the State Department official said.

<TITLE>EC OFFICIAL FAULTS U.S. TRADE BILL</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LOS ANGELES, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC
Delegation in Washington, said pending U.S. trade legislation
is a misguided attempt to deal with the nation's trade deficit
and will spark retaliation if passed in its present form.
    "To think that you can deal with a trade deficit by
legislation is a mistake," he told the Foreign Trade
Association here.
    Denman told reporters that possible retaliation, which he
warned of in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, would not necessarily be on a
product-for-product basis.
    "Retaliation does not have to be matched product to
product," Denman said.
    He said in the case of textiles import restrictions,
however, retaliation would be against U.S. textile exports.
    "Certainly, if restrictions were imposed on European
exports of textiles to the U.S., the Community would be likely
to retaliate with restrictions on U.S. textile exports to
Europe," Denman said.
    He also took exception to U.S. proposals to require
countries with large current account surpluses with the U.S. to
cut those surpluses or face special tariffs.
    "This would conflict with international obligations, throw
a large wrench into the current round of trade negotiations and
could easily boomerang," he warned of the tariff proposals.
    Denman also took exception to U.S. efforts to seek
reciprocity in specific trade sectors.
    "Forcing reciprocity in one sector by imposing barriers
would simply lead to retaliation from the other party," he
said, adding that overall reciprocity can only be achieved by
trading off disadvantages in one sector for advantages in
another.

<TITLE>GM &lt;GM> PARTS WORKERS TO VOTE ON CONTRACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LIVONIA, Mich., March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Workers at a General Motors Corp
parts plant in Michigan are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a new
contract that would change the way many of the workers do their
job.
    Some 3,000 members of the United Auto Workers at GM's
Livonia, Mich., parts plant will vote in two shifts on a local
contract to replace their current agreement with the company,
according to officials of both the union and the company.
    The proposed accord would initiate the so-called "team
concept" at the plant, which makes seat cushions and is part of
GM's Inland Division.
    Under the proposed contract, workers in one area of the
plant would be responsible for the entire product and would
make some of their own decisions about assembling that product,
said Kevin Woodward, a steward with the UAW local that
represents the workers.
    An Inland division spokesman would not discuss details of
the accord. But he said Inland has a "serious" capacity
problem.
    No wage or benefit issues are in the proposal. Those issues
are covered by a national pact between GM and the UAW. Talks on
a new national accord are expected to begin in July.
    If the contract is ratified, it would go into effect as
soon as the vote count is completed, said Ronald Catcher, a
member of the local's executive board.
    The pact would also stay in place through the next national
contract, he said.
    Catcher said the union members are sharply divided on the
new accord. "It's going to be close either way," he said.
    Many of the workers are afraid that, if the agreement is
not ratified, the plant will be shut down, union officials
said. The GM spokesman said "no decision has been made to that
effect."

allowed to take a share in stockbrokers' capital when Paris
Bourse regulations are liberalized beginning next year,
Stockbrokers' Association chairman Xavier Dupont told a news
conference.
    Finance Minister Edouard Balladur announced on March 10
that the monopoly of French stockbrokers to trade on domestic
bourses will be phased out by January 1992, the date for the
creation of a unified European financial market.
    Balladur said that from January 1988, the capital of the
brokerage houses would be opened French and foreign banks.
    The minister did not specify which other institutions would
be allowed to take stakes in the brokers' capital but said that
from January 1, 1992, "access to the Bourse will be open to any
new member under the control of the Bourse authority."
    Dupont said that in opening up the capital of the 45 Paris
brokerage houses, the stockbrokers' association had "killed one
of its sacred cows."
    Association officials said Dupont would meet all the
stockbrokers on March 31 for an exchange of views on the
measures to be taken and future of the Bourse.

    Paribas will also seek authorisation to issue bonds
convertible at any moment into ordinary shares which would
boost capital by a maximum of five billion francs, and up to
ten billion francs nominal of bonds redeemable into ordinary
shares.
    It will also ask for authorisation to issue a maximum of
ten billion francs nominal of bonds with share warrants, with a
one billion franc nominal ceiling on shares that could be

    Finally it will ask for authorisation to issue certificates
of deposit for a maximum of ten billion francs and to

<TITLE>FRENCH MINISTER RENEWS ECONOMIC CONTROVERSY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Leyla Ertugrul, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French Social Affairs and Labour Minister
Philippe Seguin has renewed a controversy over whether France
is positioning itself for an economic U-turn, saying it was
possible to boost domestic demand without giving rise to
negative economic effects.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's spokesman, Denis Baudouin,
on Monday sparked speculation of a reflation hitherto excluded
by the government when he said ministers were agreed on the
desirability of "relaunching the economy." 
    The Finance Ministry, however, swiftly ruled out the option
of reinflation policies to boost domestic demand, which were
tried and abandoned by the previous Socialist government.
    Earlier today sources close to Finance Minister Edouard
Balladur reiterated policy remained one of restoring sound
finances and enhancing economic competitiveness.
    But political analysts said Baudouin's statements showed
growing divisions over electorally sensitive social issues
among the rightist RPR-UDF coalition, ahead of its bid next
year to capture the presidency from Socialist president
Francois Mitterrand.
    While the government has achieved lower inflation, a better
foreign trade balance and an overwhelmingly successful
privatisation programme, unemployment has continued to edge
upwards, reaching its present record rate of 10.9 pct, with
more than 2.5 mln jobless.
    Seguin, who holds direct responsibility for dealing with
unemployment, told a press lunch, "Everything depends on what
you call reflation...One can arrive at the results of a
reflation without passing through the perverse effects of a
reflation."
    He said conservative prime minister Jacques Chirac would
announce in the next few days a package of capital endowments
for state-owned enterprises including public works and motorway
building.  And while sources at Seguin's ministry said the
package could total 12 billion francs for 1987, sources close
to Balladur, making no mention of public works, said only 8.6
billion francs had been set aside for capital endowments.
    Seguin said the advantage of public works was that they
were non-inflationary and had a fast job-creating power.

<TITLE>FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>French gross domestic product will grow
by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the
government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private
Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le
Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.
    However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
level of two pct.
    IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production
was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
demand, unleashing higher import demand.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298
mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of
French debts.
    Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
(FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
    French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
in 1988, it added.
    Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.
    Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,
is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE
said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.
    However, the institute said inflation would fall back to
2.5 pct at the end of 1988, "provided that real wage costs
remain within the framework of productivity rises."

billion francs to 388.68 billion francs at the end of February
from 375.95 billion at the end of January, the Finance Ministry
said.
    It said in a statement the rise was mainly due to inflows
of foreign currency through the exchange stabilisation fund,
which resulted in an increase of 12.41 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units rose by 25 mln francs
to 73.27 billion francs, due to interest adjustments, while
gold reserves rose by two mln francs to 218.46 billion francs.

calculated on a revised group of components and rebased on
January 1987, as previously announced, the Employment
Department said.
    The index, Britain's measure of inflation, is for February.
Earlier data will not be revised as there are no equivalent
figures including the new components, a spokesman said.
    Previously, the RPI base was January, 1974.
    Market forecasts centre on a 0.4-0.5 pct monthly rise in
February and a year on year rate about 4.0 pct. The government
forecasts annual inflation will be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987.

<TITLE>BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> exploration
expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a
third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would
remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker
said.
    He told reporters following the release of the company's
1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
levels.
    U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
1985.
    Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results
were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir
Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
come through remarkably well.
    Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
conditions would be right for a substantially improved
performance this year.
    He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
they were normally weaker, made him "a bit encouraged" about the
prospects for future levels.
    Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
    Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
latter part of April.
    End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
included a revised definition of reserves.
    If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
previously.
    Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
restated 3,660 billion.

<TITLE>SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Colin Brinsden, Reuters.</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Current interest by Soviet charterers in
taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To
carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent
surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures
Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said.
    Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for
the first time in the spot position since the market opened in
May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values
some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is
calculated on spot physical rates.
    No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but
they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about
50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would
normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said.
    "It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect
on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported," one said.
    Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have
subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering
conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for
the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen
steadily for vessels loading next month.
    Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering
taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.
    Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese
operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business
later in the year, they said.
    They anticipate this would appear around June and it has
prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it
normally being a slack time in the shipping year.
    Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates
turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had
supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but
then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.

<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) Commission
said it approved a 680 mln stg British government aid package
to state-owned Rover Group Plc &lt;BLLL.L> to restructure and
privatise the group's bus and truck subsidiaries.
    In a statement, the commission said Rover's &lt;Leyland
Trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically
restructured following a recently announced merger between
Leyland Trucks and &lt;DAF> of the Netherlands.
    The Commission said government aid for this program was
justified because it would contribute to Europe-wide
rationalisation of the truck sector.
    The amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln
stg the British government had planned to grant Rover by
writing off accumulated losses and other costs.
    The Commission said there was overcapacity in the European
truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct.
    It said its approval of the aid also took into account the
consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the
restructuring.
    Under EC rules, the Commission has to approve all
government aid to industry.

<TITLE>COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Lisa Vaughan, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa
buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,
ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.
    Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the
opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa
market support mechanism were improving.
    "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock
rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer
spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.
    Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the
negotiations "optimistic and realistic."
    The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when
a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,
with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions
on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about
100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250
mln dlrs.
    The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at
this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in
world cocoa prices.
    Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles
as a basis for negotiations.
    The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A
working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle
the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO
executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version
of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates
said.
    Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication
of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are
elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet
separately later today to examine the scheme.
    The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to
non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system
for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be
paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates
said.
    During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast
delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to
work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into
effect as soon as possible, Baron said.
    Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of
the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday
to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry
of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.
    Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council
session because of a conflicting International Sugar
Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,
delegates said.

<TITLE>JAPAN PLANS MORE DECONTROL ON LARGE BANK DEPOSITS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry plans to further
ease restrictions on large-denomination bank deposits this year
and is studying several deregulation plans, a ministry official
said, without elaborating.
    Banking sources told Reuters the ministry plans to lower
the minimum denomination of money market certificates (MMCs) to
10 mln yen from 20 mln, the amount slated to be applied from
April 6. The amount is currently 30 mln yen.
    The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum
period of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one month
from the current three months, the sources said.
    The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of
certificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years from
the current one month to one year, the sources said.
    They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce a
shift of funds from bank to other financial instruments.
    One official of a major bank said the planned moves were
unexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously
expected to have ended with the measures to start in April.
    On April 6, the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum
time deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and
cut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>JAPAN ECONOMIC PACKAGE AFTER BUDGET - MIYAZAWA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures
immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament.
    The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as
the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget
for the year starting April 1. An opposition boycott over a
proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business.
    Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington.
    Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or
early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June.
    Asked if he planned to visit the U.S. To attend monetary
conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in
early April, Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on
the matter, taking into account parliament debate.
    The package is likely to include a record amount of public
works spending in the first 1987/88 half, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8,800
billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1,800 billion
for public works. Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help
spur the economy, Miyazawa said.
    Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to
the controversial sales tax without any revision.
    Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks
by a top government official as indicating a revision of the
tax but the official did not mean that, Miyazawa said.

<DATELINE>    NEW YORK, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>American Express Co said it and its
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc subsidiary have been holding talks
on the possible equity investment in Shearson Lehman by &lt;Nippon
Life Insurance Co> of Japan.
    The company said, "The discussions have led to a general
understanding by which Nippon Life would purchase a 13 pct
equity investment in Shearson Lehman for approximately 530 mln
dlrs and American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life
would explore mutually advantageous, nonexclusive business and
investment opportunities."
    The company said a definitive agreement on the matter is
subject to a number of conditions, including approval of the
American Express board and the Japanese Ministry of Finance.
    The company said its board is scheduled to meet March 27
for its regular monthly sessions.
    American Express said it is continuing to evaluate various
courses of action of strategic importance to Shearson Lehman in
addition to the possible investment by Nippon Life.
    It said the options range from expanding Shearson's
capacity to meet international competition, to broadening
further its access to capital.
    The company also said, "All the courses of action under
study reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson Lehman
in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy."

imposed a penalty tax on &lt;Fuji Bank Ltd> for alleged improper
use of tax-free reserves, a bank spokeswoman told Reuters.
    She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but
another bank official said it has not paid the penalty.
    The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use
of the tax-free reserves is legal.
    Financial institutions can set aside 0.003 pct of their
risky loans as tax-free reserves. Fuji said a difference of
understanding exists between the bank and the tax bureau
regarding the use of tax-free reserves. It did not elaborate.
    Fuji Bank reported a 72.1 billion yen net profit in the
1985/86 year. Lending totaled 16,120 billion yen.

<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Nippon Life Insurance Co> is pursing a
possible link with an American securities house to expand its
overseas investment portfolio, a company spokesman said.
    But he declined to comment on rumours the company would
take a 10 pct stake in &lt;Shearson Lehman Brothers>, an
investment banking unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
    He said the firm started to sound out several U.S.
Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago
and was narrowing the number of prospects, but he did not say
if it had set its sights on one firm.
    Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, also plans to
set up a wholly owned investment unit, &lt;Nissei International
America>, in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada,
Singapore, the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year, he said.
    These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put
more emphasis on overseas investment management as
opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets
are growing.
    The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth
of U.S. Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm
foothold there, the spokesman added.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO ASK CHIP MAKERS TO SLASH OUTPUT FURTHER</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Ministry of International Trade and
Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further
slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its
semiconductor pact with the United States, MITI officials said.
    The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the
semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price
Japanese chips to Asian markets. Washington has threatened to
take retaliatory action after April 1.
    The pact, agreed last year, calls on Japan to stop selling
cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of
American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus.
    MITI, anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement, has been
pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will
boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export.
    Last month, the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to
reduce first quarter output by 10 pct. To meet that request,
they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks
of the first quarter.
    If that reduced production level were maintained through to
the end of June, second quarter output would come in 10 pct
below that of the first three months of the year.
    MITI officials, who declined to be identified, said the
ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second
quarter cutback.
    One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in
Asia to South Korean and U.S. Competition just as markets there
are picking up.
    MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese
semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts
to ensure the success of the Japan/U.S. Chip pact.

<TITLE>JAPAN SAYS OECD STUDY ON SUBSIDIES STILL ONGOING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials
said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for
Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, is still under way
and will be completed sometime next month.
    The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far,
and they said Japan would comment on the final results.
    A Reuter report from Washington yesterday said the study
has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in
the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other
commodity producers from subsidies. The study has not been
officially released due to objections from some countries.
    Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the
release of the study, the agriculture ministry officials said.
OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting
in mid-May.
    One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was
based on the years 1979-81. Japanese subsidies have dropped
sharply since then, partly because of tight budgetary policy,
and foreign currency factors have also changed, he said.
    "The study is ... Unfair and unacceptable because it does
not take account of various differences in farming conditions
in each country, such as geography," the source said.
    He said it is highly likely that the final study will show
Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world.
    "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm
market further, but this would have little impact on Japan's
agriculture policy," he said, without giving further details.
    A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies
by major exporting nations like the United States and the
European Community, but Japan is a major importer, he said.

<TITLE>QUEBEC CAISSE EARNS THREE BILLION DLRS IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MONTREAL, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Caisse de depot et placement du
Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's
pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net
profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
    The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
    These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in
the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
    The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
    The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded
a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
13.5 pct for all funds under management.
    "These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient," the agency
said of the U.S. securities.
    The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in
Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln
dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.
    The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of
Quebec bonds and 342 mln dlrs of new securities from other
Quebec government issuers during the year.

<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>LAC Minerals Ltd said it will suspend
underground mining and exploration at its Lake Shore Mine at
Kirkland Lake, Ontario, on April 30, pending results of a
surface exploration drilling program.
    LAC said it does not expect the decision to affect
earnings, but 44 employees will be affected.
    The company said it has completed mining the crown pillar
which has produced 71,000 ounces of gold since 1983. In 1986,
the mine produced 10,600 ounces. LAC said it will continue
surface drilling in 1987 to determine if further underground
exploration work is warranted.

<TITLE>CANADA COMMITTEE SEEKS LOWER CREDIT CARD RATES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The all-party House of Commons Finance
Committee has unanimously called for a "substantial" cut in
credit card interest rates charged by banks and other financial
institutions.
    In a report, the committee recommended that if action is
not taken soon, the government should investigate whether there
is "anti-competitive behaviour" among the banks.
    Minister of State for Finance Tom Hockin told the Commons
prior to the release of the report he favored a cut in the
rates and promised to act quickly on its recommendations.
    The committee said interest rates should be lowered to no
more than the 15.9 pct per annum level announced recently by
the Toronto Dominion Bank.
    Rates on other bank cards range from 18 to 21 pct and to 24
to 28 pct on gasoline and department store cards.
    At a news conference, committee members said they would
call for a legislated rate ceiling if the banks do not take
action quickly.
    "I would be unhappy if they didn't make an announcement
next week," said Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn, also a member
of the ruling Progressive Conservative Party.
    New Democratic Party member Michael Cassidy said, "I hope
the banks see the writing on the wall and take appropriate
action."
    The group did recommend legislation be enacted to ensure a
uniform method of calculating interest on unpaid balances and
that a grace period be allowed for new purchases.

<TITLE>ALLIED-LYONS SEES SUBSTANTIAL SECOND HALF GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>&lt;Allied-Lyons PLC> will report
substantial growth in the second half of fiscal 1987 ended
March 7, chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said in answer to
reporters' queries.
    "You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons
in the second half," Holden-Brown said following a presentation
to Toronto securities analysts.
    Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in
profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
    Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the
company, Holden-Brown also said.
    But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct
interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
    "So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
hopefully you win them all in the end," Holden-Brown said.
    Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other
take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: "No, I don't."
    "We must never be complacent and we must always be very
watchful, but I think we would be very expensive," he said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate
earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
in the food and beverage industry.
    "That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
think," Holden-Brown said.
    Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram
Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
take-over bid for the company was "100 pct a growth action."
    "We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)
defensive, but it never was," Holden-Brown told reporters.
    Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share
issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
Walker, Holden-Brown responded: "Plan might be too strong a
word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be
better known in Canada."

<TITLE>GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>West Germany's money supply growth
slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is
still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
    Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with
statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,
short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually
strongly in January.
    In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings
of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.
    Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.
    In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time
deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash
and sight deposits, rose seven pct.
    International transactions of non-banks again led to a
significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.
    Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1
billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.
    But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the
inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.
    Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.
    A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected
the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in
long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.
    At the end of February total bank credits to the private
sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.
    The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.
    Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
banks and the Bundesbank.
    Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
supply growth to a larger extent than in January.
    A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed
with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.

    The spokesman declined to say exactly how large the losses

    The fact that powers had been exceeded emerged in a routine

<TITLE>WEIZSAECKER CALLS FOR EASIER ARGENTINA DEBT TERMS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BUENOS AIRES, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker called on creditor banks to ease pressure on
Argentina's foreign debt repayment terms.
    "We cannot remain indifferent to the pressure of creditor
banks, since there is correlation between political stability
and the economic situation," Weizsaecker told reporters.
    Argentina said last month it would suspend debt payments if
creditor banks did not loosen repayment terms and grant a new
2.15 billion dlr loan.
    Argentina's debt is Latin America's third largest at 51
billion dlrs.
    Weizsaecker, on a four-day official visit to Argentina,
said: "Argentina's problems require joint action from creditor
and debtors countries," and not prepared recipes from creditor
banks.
    A group of ecologists staged a demonstration to protest
Argentina's plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant and a
German company's role in the project as a contractor.
    Earlier, Weizsaecker said that the potential of Patagonia,
the barren tableland covering a third of Argentina, could
assure the economic future of the country.

<TITLE>PORSCHE HALF-YEAR EARNINGS CALLED SATISFACTORY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 19 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dr. Ing. H.C.F. Porsche AG &lt;PSHG.F>
said earnings in first half year 1986/87 were "satisfactory"
despite burdens caused by the dollar's weakness against the
mark and stagnating domestic demand.
    In its semi-annual shareholders' report, Porsche said first
half turnover fell six pct to 1.71 billion marks from 1.83
billion in the same period of 1985/86.
    However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without
giving absolute figures.
    Domestic turnover fell 26 pct to 283 mln marks from 380
mln.
    Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
billion in the first half of last year, although the export
quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
    The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of
turnover, against 1.63 billion the year earlier, it said.
    Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.
Manufacture of the 911 and 928 models rose six pct to 11,122
from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
the report said.
    Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the
comparable half year, the report said. U.S. Demand continued
for all models but demand fell in other markets.
    Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
    Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
    Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
    Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
year at a "high level," Porsche said.

<TITLE>EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BRUSSELS, March 20 - </DATELINE><BODY>The European Community (EC) agreed
tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and
buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast
stretches of the region's forests.
    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed
member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few
years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main
source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.
    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with
tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and
for all new vehicles from October 1990.
    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of
nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year
from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all
heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.
    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in
the EC, according to Commission figures.
    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move
towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn
requested permission to do so to encourage the use of
low-pollution cars, diplomats said.
    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for
such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC
environment ministers meet next on May 21.
    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany
did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide
ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.
    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats
said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20
mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no
damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.
    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special
permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition
laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement
a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.
