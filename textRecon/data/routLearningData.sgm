<TITLE>U.S. ASKS JAPAN END AGRICULTURE IMPORT CONTROLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. Wants Japan to eliminate import
controls on agricultural products within three years, visiting
U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis
told Eishiro Saito, Chairman of the Federation of Economic
Organisations (Keidanren), a spokesman for Keidanren said.
    The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures
would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by
Congress.
    Wallis, who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral
trade meeting, made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito.
    Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants
Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any U.S.
Trade bill is a moderate one, rather than containing
retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country.
    He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were
Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five
years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three,
the spokesman said.
    Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural
products. A ban on rice imports triggered recent U.S.
Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy.

<TITLE>EQUATORIAL COMMUNICATIONS &lt;EQUA> TO HAVE LOSSES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Equatorial Communications
Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
for the year.
    Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
    Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
    Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
    Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
    Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
period for repayment starting in December 1988.
    The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
occurrence of certain events.
    Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
    Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
    Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>U.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The U.S. index of leading indicators
fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised
2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.
    The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in
December.
    The decline in January was the biggest for any month since
July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.
    The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967
base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for
plant and equipment.
    A total of six of 10 indicators available for January
contributed to the decline.
    Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they
were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer
goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower
deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for
state unemployment insurance.
    Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock
prices, new business formation, average work week and money
supply.
    The main factor for the December upward revision was new
business formation.
    There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the
leading indicators index for November.
    The index of coincident indicators, which measures the
current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7
pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.
    The index of lagging indicators, which measures past
economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of
0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.

<TITLE>REGAN DEPARTURE MAKES 3RD VOLCKER TERM LIKELY</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Last week's White House shake-up has
increased the odds that Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul
Volcker, a symbol of strength in a government reeling from the
arms-to-Iran scandal, will serve a third term, sources close to
the Fed say.
    But they said that no decision on the appointment, which
must be filled this August, has been taken by the White House
and Volcker too has not made up his mind.
    Former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, who
resigned last week when ex-senator Howard Baker was named as
his replacement, was implacably opposed to Volcker and tried
often to undermine him.
    It is an open secret in Washington that Regan tried to
ensure that Volcker, first appointed in 1979 by President
Carter, will not be offered a third term by President Reagan.
    Only Volcker's key allies in the Reagan administration,
Vice-President George Bush and Treasury Secretary James Baker,
kept Regan's recent maneuvering at bay, the sources said.
    Sources close to the administration say Regan leaked a
story, quickly shot down by others in the administration, that
Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the council of economic advisers,
had been chosen to replace Volcker.
    But as the administration's credibility was increasingly
under fire, it became clear that Regan's power to bring about
such changes was on the wane.
    The sources said New White House Chief of Staff Howard
Baker has a very good relationship with his namesake at the
Treasury Department and is likely to respect his views on the
Fed chairmanship.
    As a moderate Republican, Baker is also unlikely to share
the right-wing's opposition to Volcker.
    "This new White House is going to need all the strength it
can get," said one source when asked about the possibility of
Volcker's reappointment.
    Paul Volcker is deeply respected in financial markets both
in the United States and around the world. At a time when the
stability of the dollar and the viability of major debtor
nations are in question, Volcker's departure would definitely
undermine U.S. leadership, foreign exchange analysts say.
    U.S. officials say Volcker works very closely with Treasury
Secretary Baker on issues like international debt and global
economic cooperation.
    The two men seem only to differ on how far to deregulate
the banking industry, but recent statements by Volcker, in
which he adopted a more liberal attitude on deregulation,
signalled the politically-independent central bank is coming
around at least partially to the Treasury position.
    And a recent statement by a Reagan administration official
that the two men saw "exactly eye-to-eye" on the dollar was seen
as an indication of Baker's support for the Fed chairman.
    Baker is understood to have played a key role in Volcker's
reappointment to the Fed in mid-1983.
    The sources said Baker respects Volcker and when appointed
Treasury Secretary in February 1985, he decided to ensure a
good working relationship, in part because he believed the two
key government economic institutions have to work closely.
    Regan, Treasury Secretary during President Reagan's first
term, was formerly head of Wall Street's largest brokerage firm
Merrill Lynch and came to Washington determined to be America's
pre-eminent economic spokesman.
    He developed a deep antipathy for Volcker, whose political
skills undermined that ambition, and who financial markets took
much more seriously.
    But the sources said Volcker would have to be invited to
stay. "Is the president going to ask him? he wouldn't stay
otherwise," said one. "He'd have to be asked," said Stephen
Axilrod, formerly staff director of monetary policy at the Fed
and now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities Co. International.
    Otherwise, the list of potential candidates is not
awe-inspiring. And if Volcker left this Augsut, he would leave
behind one of the most inexperienced Fed Boards in years.
    Many analysts believe this lack of collective experience --
the four sitting members were all appointed within the last
three years -- is dangerous, coming at a time when the global
economy is threatened by instability.
    An experienced successor, therefore, would seem a
necessity. One widely mentioned possibility is Secretary of
State George Shultz, whose experience as Treasury Secretary
under Preesident Nixon and background as a trained economist
would make him ideal.
    But Shultz too may have been damaged by the arms-to-Iran
scandal, while vice-chairman Manuel Johnson is regarded at 37
years old as too young for the job.
    Other potential candidates include economist Alan
Greenspan, frequently an informal presidential economic
adviser, New York Fed President E. Gerald Corrigan, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp chairman William Seidman, and Sprinkel.
    Long a Regan protege, Sprinkel's chances may be damaged by
his patron's departure from the White House.

director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Robert
Gates, withdrew his name from consideration by the Senate in
the face of a long battle for confirmation.
    His withdrawal was announced at a White House news
conference by Reagan's new Chief-of-Staff, Howard Baker, who
said the President had accepted it with great regret.
    Gates, now deputy head of the CIA, had been questioned
about CIA involvement in the Iran-contra scandal and leading
senators had warned his nomination was in trouble. Baker said
Gates would remain as deputy director of the spy agency.

<TITLE>SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The federal Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
    During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
    It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
    In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
proceeds to buy TRE stock.
    Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
    The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
holdings were working together without disclosing their
cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
laws.
    One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
dlr bond offering.
    A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
    The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
been interviewed by the SEC probers.
    A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
    The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
and had heard nothing more since that time.
    "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid,
he said.
    A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
    "We had nothing to do with TRE."
    As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
comment on its enforcement activities.

pretax operating profit on a replacement cost basis to 182 mln

    Sales and operating revenue fell to 3.1 billion stg from
4.2 billion on a replacement cost basis. Historical cost
operating profit was 61 mln stg, up from 16 mln.
    BP Oil said 1985 profits had been depressed by exceptional
items. Its profit figures were stated before interest charges.
    Chief executive David Kendall said improved results
mirrored benefits of a restructuring program undertaken in
recent years.
    However, he warned future financial pressure on the
industry will be severe.
    "The U.K. Oil marketing and refining industry will need to
invest larger sums - probably around 500 mln stg a year - for a
good many years," he said in a statement.

<DATELINE>    DUBLIN, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>H.J. Heinz &lt;HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reilly
would be interested in buying Guinness PLC &lt;GUIN.L>'s brewery
division if it were for sale, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,
said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the
brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together
a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."
    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as
saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that
he had the support of two international banks if he decided
such a purchase might be worthwhile.
    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing
profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,
the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.
    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for
the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he
said.
    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,
but not impossible," he added.
    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and
Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an
integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said.

<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group saw
improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the
Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.
    Very good progress was made last year, while the recent
acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant
addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to
come.
    Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax
profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period,
making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full
year.
    Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to
the more conventional practice of depreciating assets
individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average
rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the
accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the
net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at
January 1, 1987.
    Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in
buoyant response to the results and share split proposal,
though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers
added.

<TITLE>U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Britain's gold and currency reserves
showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a
72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.
    The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England
operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of
borrowings and repayments.
    This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.
    The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity
of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn
and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.
    Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26
billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.
    Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were
36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while
repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a
Treasury spokesman said.
    Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January,
capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation
change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the
quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
swap.
    The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's
market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank
of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound
today.
    A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures,
said that the government does not want sterling either to rise
too far or to fall substantially from current levels.
    He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.

<TITLE>CURRENCY SECTORS CONTINUE TO FEATURE EUROBOND TRADE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Early dollar straight eurobond trade was
quiet with currency sectors, particularly eurosterling,
continuing to perform strongly, closely reflecting current
trading patterns on the foreign exchanges, dealers said.
    Eurosterling bonds continued to rise steadily, bolstered by
the extremely ebullient tone of the U.K. Government bond market
on a combination of positive U.K. Economic fundamentals.
    The dollar was initially stabler but most dollar straight
bonds were static in dull trade. A handful of issues showed
signs of weakness but dealers said investors were awaiting
today's release of U.S. Leading indicators for January.
    The U.S. Data due out this afternoon is expected to be
weak, placing the U.S. Unit under renewed pressure and robbing
the market in dollar-denominated eurobonds of fresh trading
impetus, one dollar straight trader said.
    "It's going to be another tedious day and I can't see how
anybody is going to make any money," he said.
    Eurosterling issues continued to rally on the back of
general sterling euphoria -- with the U.K. Currency trading at
six month highs on interest rate optimism and the strength of
the domestic equity markets.
    Eurosterling bonds saw early gains of up to half a point.
    However, some eurosterling dealers noted the bonds could
soon fall back marginally if -- as expected -- professionals
stepped in to take profits at current healthy levels.
    Trade in mark-denominated bonds was expected to be subdued
today due to pre-Lenten carnival festivities in West Germany.
    There were signs of reawakened investor nerves affecting
trade in the floating rate note market which yesterday started
the week extremely quietly after a hectic sell-off last week.
    FRN dealers said paper of U.S. -- and also of Canadian --
banks was seeing some pressure as a result of recent press
reports focussing on their exposure to Latin American debt.
    "(Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson) Funaro's visit to
Europe has also brought the spotlight back onto the debt crisis
after things had more or less quietened down following the
first shock statements last week," one FRN specialist said.
    Despite the dearth of activity in the dollar straight
secondary market, two new dollar issues were the only early
features on the primary market.
    These were a five year 150 mln dlr deal launched by Morgan
Guaranty Ltd for Saab Scania at 7-3/4 pct priced at 101-3/4
pct.
    The other issue was a 100 mln dlr deal -- also due 1992 --
for NV Nederlandse Gasunie paying 7-1/4 pct and priced at
101-1/8 pct, with Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd as lead manager.
    Dealers predicted reasonable demand for both issues due
mainly to a lack of fresh, good name paper in the market.

received a mandate from Industrial Equity Ltd (IEL) of
Australia to arrange a letter of credit facility in support of
100 mln dlrs of medium term notes and U.S. Commercial paper to
be sold in the U.S. Domestic market.
    Merrill, which will be the dealer for the medium term notes
and commercial paper, said this was the first facility of its
kind.  Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd has agreed to provide
the letter of credit.
    The letter of credit has a five year term, with an
evergreen feature allowing for extension at the support banks'
option.
    The notes and paper will be issued by IEL's Sydney-based
subsidiary, IEL Finance Ltd.
    The letter of credit will be underwritten by a group of
banks who will be paid a 20 basis point facility fee and a 25
basis point utilisation fee.
    IEL itself is 51 pct owned by Brierley Investments Ltd of
New Zealand, Merrill Lynch said.

<TITLE>FISONS SEES STRONG INTERNATIONAL GROWTH IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Fisons Plc &lt;FISN.L> said strong
international growth had been the main feature of the group's
1986 progress, with the pharmaceutical division reporting a 50
pct increase in U.S. Sales during the period.
    The rise was due to a sustained marketing programme, a
larger sales force and the introduction of an aerosol form of
its Intal anti-asthma drug, which pushed U.S. Sales up 70 pct.
    The company was commenting on 1986 results which saw
pre-tax profits rising to 85.1 mln stg from 72.3 mln in 1985.
The result was in line with market forecasts, but its shares
nevertheless eased in a falling market to 634p at 0857 GMT from
643p.
    Fisons said the potential for future growth of Intral, as
well as its Opticrom and Nasalcrom products, was clearly
indicated by a strong 1986 performance.
    The scientific equipment business had raised the proportion
of high technology products it manufactures and also raised its
ability to generate higher margins. The horticulture operations
had demonstrated outstanding marketing ability. Underlying cash
flow from all three operations had been positive despite a full
programme of capital investment.
    Action to protect the group against foreign currency
movements resulted in a small net gain to profits.

Coffee Organization (ICO) council failed to agree on how to set
coffee export quotas, ICO delegates said.
    Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the
issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often
heated talks, delegates said.
    Export quotas -- the major device of the International
Coffee Agreement to stabilise prices -- were suspended a year
ago after coffee prices soared in reaction to a drought in
Brazil which cut its output by two thirds.
    Delegates and industry representatives predicted coffee
prices could plummet more than 100 stg a tonne to new four year
lows tomorrow in response to the results of the meeting.

    Funaro was in Britain on the first leg of a tour of

<TITLE>CURRENCIES COULD INFLUENCE BULLION AGAIN-MONTAGU</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    LONDON, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Currency fluctuations may reassert their
influence on the bullion market in the near future, bullion
bankers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said in a market report.
    But the firm said silver may lag behind gold in any
reactions to movements on foreign exchanges.
    "OPEC's failure to address the recent decline in oil prices
remains a worrying factor however, and on balance it appears
that the market should be approached cautiously," Montagu said.
    The bank said the US economy has shown no noticeable
long-term improvement and that both Latin American debt and the
Iranian arms affair could undermine confidence in the dollar.

<TITLE>DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

<TITLE>JAPAN TO PROMOTE INTEREST RATE LIBERALISATION</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of Japan decided at a policy
board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation
by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large
deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money
market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.
    The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank
said.
    Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of
regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen
from 300 mln.
    The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of
between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage
point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the
bank said.
    But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less
will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD
rates.
    The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln
yen from 30 mln.
    The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by
0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut
in the official discount rate on February 23.
    New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at
banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum,
respectively.
    Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED DROP IN JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS TRIMMED</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The combined profits of Japan's major
corporations, excluding financial institutions, are forecast to
fall 19.2 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31, compared to
the 19.9 pct decline projected in late November, Wako Research
Institute of Economics said.
    The private research body also said in a statement that 437
of the 1,084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange foresee an 11.6 pct fall in sales in the year
against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.
    Current profits are projected to fall 4.4 pct in 1987/88 on
sales seen increasing by 4.2 pct, it said.
    Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries
to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten
their business outlook, the institute said.
    It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce
corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved
performance outlook.
    Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will
be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction
businesses, it said.
    The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates
of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88.

<TITLE>JAPAN SALES TAX MAY FORCE NAKASONE OUT OF OFFICE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely
to leave office this summer amid opposition to his
controversial tax-reform package, political analysts said.
    They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has
suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct
sales tax planned for January 1988.
    "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the
end of his administration, which is not only impossible but
also is very irresponsible as a politican," Rei Shiratori,
professor of politics at Dokkyo University, told Reuters.
    "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as
parliament approves the sales tax, probably in the summer,"
Shiratori said.
    Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of
parliament have spoken against the tax, which Nakasone says is
needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes.
    Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP
members who oppose the tax. "There are some who are objecting
because of their constituencies," he told a meeting of
government and party leaders. "If the party discipline is
broken, I would like to see punishment considered."
    "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue, partly
because Nakasone breached his election pledge against
introducing it," Shiratori said.
    "Moreover, the tax is being introduced when the public feels
uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's
appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is
rapidly aging," he said.
    Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect
the more than 2,500 local elections scheduled for April,
involving governors, mayors, town and village heads and
assemblies at all levels.
    But the situation is complicated, since opposition parties
excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with
the LDP, the political analysts added.
    Shiratori said, "In the worst case, implementation of the
sales tax, now scheduled for next January, may be put off for
some time before the government makes a final decision.
    "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to
perhaps three pct.
    "A third alternative for the government is to ram through
the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs," he said.
    Seizaburo Sato, professor of politics at Tokyo University,
thought the last possibility most likely. "I think the LDP alone
will take a vote on the tax bills," he said.
    The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and
143 in the 252-seat Upper House.
    To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP
pushes through the tax bills, the Nakasone cabinet will have to
resign, Sato said.
    "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to
return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed," he said.

<TITLE>JAPAN PLANS MORE FLEXIBLE CORPORATE BOND ISSUES</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Yoshiko Mori, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japanese securities houses will issue new
corporate bonds more quickly, accept issue requests throughout
the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive
underwriting method from April 1, to bring Japanese firms back
to the Tokyo bond market, securities managers said.
    Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more
companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash, but
the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of
public bond issues, they said.
    "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only
to straight corporate bonds, but also convertible bonds and
warrant bonds, to call back issuers effectively from overseas
markets," a Nikko Securities house bond manager said.
    Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after
a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now,
the securities managers said.
    Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance
system, in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end,
and accept issue requests during the month, they said.
    Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition
among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in
order to better reflect the market, securities managers said.
    Market participants expect the new issue methods to be
applied beginning in April, with the projected issue by &lt;Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp>.
    The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of
taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented
decisions on terms, securities sources said.
    The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns
underwriting corporate bonds.
    Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by
securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest
public bonds is now almost automatic, they said.
    The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in
late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond
market, securities house managers said.
    The finance ministry, commissioned banks and securities
houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for
companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and
convertible bonds from March 1, securities managers said.
    The cut will more than double the number of corporations
able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight
bonds and 180 for convertibles now, securities managers said.
    The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange
Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration
system, more use of corporate ratings systems and
simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing
process, securities sources said.
    It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank
system, which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds, and
for deregulation of private placements, they said.
    Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put
into effect, the sources said. A shelf registration system
would need a revision of Japanese commercial law, expected in
1988, the sources said.

<TITLE>JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan is expected to cut the base lending
rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as
part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris,
Finance Ministry sources said.
    They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund
Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3,
abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with
the bureau.
    The bureau channels funds to government financial
institutions for public works and other official uses, they
said.
    The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan
Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance
corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in
tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.
    However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut,
to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund
Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.
    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a
market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the
domestic economy, they said.
    On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut
their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28.
The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors
using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and
Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of
the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.
    These ministries are trying to determine which market rates
should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate,
the ministry sources said.
    Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1
percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.

<TITLE>JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, Feb 27 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unadjusted consumer price index
(base 1985) fell 0.4 pct to 99.7 in January from the previous
month, the government's Management and Coodination Agency said.
    The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.
    The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1
pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct
in September 1958.
    Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell
for clothing, footwear and utilities, causing the overall
decline for the month.
    Housing, medical and educations costs increased in January
compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities,
gasoline and vegetables fell.
    The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
(base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month
earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing
and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down
0.7 pct due to lower vegetable, fuel oil and utility costs.

<TITLE>JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jeff Stearns, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
    December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
statistics under its current system in 1953.
    "There is a general fear that we will become a country with
high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
    The government, which published the January unemployment
figures today, did not make any predictions.
    "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
improving," a Labour Ministry official said.
    Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
    The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
and ceased hiring, economists said.
    Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
Ltd's economics department.
    However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
manufacturing sector over the next five years.

<TITLE>JAPAN RULING PARTY FIXES DATE OF BUDGET HEARING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for
1987/88 through Parliament, deepening a clash with the
opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable.
    In the absence of the opposition, LDP members of parliament
decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to
hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14,
parliamentary officials said.
    The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last
Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a
controversial government-proposed sales tax plan.
    Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been
delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax
on which the budget plan is based.
    A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again
boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind.
    Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, who has vowed to push
through the tax reforms, told reporters: "Watching closely
negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, I would
like to avoid ... Passing (the budget) singlehandedly."
    The five pct tax, part of Nakasone's tax reform plan, is
planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual
income and corporate tax.
    The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing
because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the
budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower
House plenary session, political analysts said.
    The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an
unforgivable, rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the
sales tax.

    Japan faces serious unemployment unless more construction
bonds, to raise cash for public works, are issued but Japan

said.

<TITLE>CREDITORS SEEK SWIFT RESCUE PACKAGE FOR JAPAN LINE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>A group of creditor banks hopes to work
out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd &lt;JLIT.T>, one of the
world's largest tanker operators, by the end of Japan's
business year on March 31, a spokesman for the Industrial Bank
of Japan Ltd &lt;IBJT.T> (IBJ) said.
    Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the
end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and
reserves totalling 63.40 billion.
    In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of
about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153
billion in loans to its subsidiaries.
    Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the
world shipping recession had hit the company hard.
    The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and
three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in
loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy
seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.
    The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line's largest creditor, said
the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and
will be worked out before long.
    Commenting on the article, he said the details of the
package have not yet been settled.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN LOW GROWTH MODEL</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    TOKYO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Healthy growth in corporate profits and in
consumer spending, the two pillars on which Japan rests its
hopes of sustained economic growth, both look rotten at the
core, economists polled by Reuters said.
    Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace
exports as the engine of growth. But close ties between
corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative
economic model promises little but slower growth, they said.
    Falling profits may lead to falling incomes, which in turn
will cut sales and further reduce profits.
    The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved
terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic
demand grow steadily.
    However, this would happen only if household spending
increased in line with the value of real financial assets due
to stable prices, and/or if corporate investment recovered as
profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from
exports.
    "No clear sign of such developments has so far been
evidenced," the central bank said.
    Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth
will be slow, even though Japan's terms of trade have improved
sharply due to the strong yen. Economist David Pike of Phillips
and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct
while output prices fell only eight pct, giving a large price
margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies
did not pass that advantage on to the consumer.
    Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the
fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in
consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of
trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors.
    The economists, however, believe this layer of fat will
protect companies for only a short while. As more firms seek
more profits at home instead of abroad, already fierce domestic
competition will increase, fueled by lower-priced imports.
Retail prices will fall. Profit margins will suffer.
    A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren
confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves.
    Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector, almost
80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production
volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance,
said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara.
    Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting
unprofitable operations, reducing work to sub-contractors
(which employ significant numbers of workers), holding down
wages, and reducing bonuses. The government has said it fears
unemployment could soon double from three pct now.
    Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt
sales. But reduced bonuses, and worries about individual
financial security could be even more damaging.
    Twice a year, bonuses provide wage earners with what
amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings, encouraging them to
buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza.
    To save funds, some big firms have begun a form of tied
bonus, forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods.
    Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than
the average 16 pct of salary they do now. On the contrary, a
poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the
resolve to put money aside for old age and illness, education,
and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary.
    The last government survey of public opinion said over 80
pct of citizens will continue to economise. Japan has a rapidly
ageing population and minimal social security and its workers
fear poverty in their old age.
    Faced with such a vicious circle, the government's
reflationary strategies are severely limited.
    The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small
supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive
without reducing revenue. Independent economists have been less
than excited at the results.
    Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited.
    The 2.5 pct discount rate is so low it is politically
impossible to cut it further, with the basic bank savings rate
at only 0.25 pct, Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said.
    Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some
kind of deposit, official figures show.
    Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while
firms are planning cuts in capital investment.
    The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land
prices are the only current results of high liquidity.
    Fear of inflation also limits policy options. Political
analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big
election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price
inflation. And he found this year that attempts to impose a
sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition.

<TITLE>CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he
expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming
year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of
1986.
    "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference
following presentation of the central bank's annual report in
the House of Commons today.
    He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy,
particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth
quarter. Yesterday, Statistics Canada reported gross domestic
product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter.
    Crow reiterated the bank's previous statements that
inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy
and said only zero inflation would be acceptable. Canada's
inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark.
    The governor said Canada's banking system remains sound
despite recent concern about exposure by the country's banks in
debt plagued countries such as Brazil.
    "It (the debt problem) is not a happy development but I
think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact," Crow told
reporters.

<TITLE>DOME&lt;DMP> DEBT PLAN LIKELY CIRCULATED NEXT WEEK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    TORONTO, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>Dome Petroleum Ltd's plan to reschedule
debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs will likely be
detailed to a group of 56 major creditors on Monday or Tuesday
next week, a company spokesman said.
    Circulation of the complex plan to reschedule the company's
debt was delayed to incorporate late changes resulting from
discussions with Dome's lenders, spokesman David Annesley told
Reuters in response to an inquiry.
    Annesley said Dome expects its debt will total between 6.3
billion and 6.5 billion dlrs by June 30, 1987, when it hopes to
implement the debt plan now under negotiation.
    Annesley said Dome Petroleum would issue a statement
outlining the company's debt rescheduling proposal following
release of the plan to lenders.
    Dome Petroleum previously said it hoped to submit the debt
plan by mid-February in order to win agreement in principle
from creditors prior to June 30.
    The group of major lenders have agreed to defer a
substantial amount of debt payments until June 30 under an
interim agreement that links payments to secured lenders with
cash flow generated by assets backing the loans.
    Annesley also said there was no change in the status of
legal actions initiated by six Swiss noteholders who are
seeking interest and principal payment on their unsecured debt.
    Together, the noteholders are owed about 520,000 Swiss
francs, and their legal action places a total of 300 mln Swiss
franc denominated debt in default.
    Annesley said the company's next scheduled appearance in a
Swiss court to defend against the actions is set for March 16.
    Dome Petroleum's 1986 fourth quarter and year earnings will
likely be reported at the end of March, he also said.

<TITLE>BANK OF CANADA MADE AGGRESSIVE USE OF T-BILLS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    OTTAWA, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian government's reduced
borrowing needs enabled the Bank of Canada to make "aggressive
use" of short term debt instruments and pare the cost of
financing in 1986, the central bank said in its annual report.
    The report, authored by retired governor Gerald Bouey, also
noted advances to Canadian banks fell to under one billion dlrs
at the end of the year from more than four billion dlrs in
January, 1986, and that the country's economy performed
unevenly while inflation remained a major concern.
    Bouey said the bank was able to reduce the number of new
bond issues with maturities of 10 years of more, lessen the
reliance on Canada Savings Bonds while raising substantailly
more through short term treasury bill financings.
    "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant
that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances
and lower financing costs," said Bouey who was replaced by
deputy governor John Crow last month.
    The amount of treasury bills outstanding at year end was
69.7 billion dlrs, an increase of 10.3 billion dlrs over the
year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984.
    The reduction in borrrowing needs was brought about by an
eight billion dlr decline in the government's financing
requirements, a run down in Ottawa's cash balances, and
generation of 2.3 billion dlrs from foreign exchange
transactions.
    Also in pursuit of shorter term financing, the bank made
greater use of bond auctions to market new issues with two to
five year maturities, Bouey said.
    Bouey said payments to chartered banks, which are made to
banks that are facing liquidity problems, dropped to an average
of 832.3 mln dlrs at end of December from a peak of 5.2 billion
dlrs in March, 1986.
    The advances were made largely to four banks, Canadian
Commercial Bank, Northland Bank, Continental Bank of Canada and
the Bank of British Columbia. The first two banks have been
liquidated, which enabled partial repayment of advances, and
the remaining two banks were sold and the new owners repaid the
advances.

<TITLE>CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WINNIPEG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Canadian Wheat Board has advised
the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to
farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year
beginning August 1, a board spokesman said.
    The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended
price drops but said it would not be good news for western
Canadian grain growers.
    "They're all lower," he said. "This is really getting
pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival
and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."
    Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will
recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.
    Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is
delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.
    If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain,
obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the
farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If
prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.
    The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in
April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the
federal cabinet.
    Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27
pct but last fall the government announced a one billion
Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.
    But federal agricultural officials have already warned
farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.

said in an interview.
    The union represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes
and Canada's East and West coasts. Contract talks broke off in
January and a conciliator has been appointed to try to help
settle the dispute. The current contract expires at the end of
March.
    The seafarers' employers are also asking for a reduction in
crew levels, a move which the union said would cost about 400
jobs.

result in cost reduction and elimination of unprofitable and
non-strategic products and services.
    The company's operating loss for the nine months ended
December 31, 1986 increased to 7.7 mln dlrs from a loss of 1.7
mln dlrs in the prior year, it said earlier.
    Revenues increased by 20 pct to 11.8 mln dlrs from
year-earlier 9.8 mln dlrs.

<TITLE>DAIMLER OUTPUT COULD BE AFFECTED BY DISPUTE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    STUTTGART, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Daimler-Benz AG [DAIG.F] said its car
production could fall by 150 cars a day in  the foreseeable
future  if works councils continue to refuse to approve the
firm's requests for employees to work overtime when necessary.
    A company spokesman said the works council at Daimler's
Unterturkheim plant, which makes axles and other components for
Daimler cars, has withheld approval for overtime since the
beginning of the month. The IG Metall metalworkers union in the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has called on works councils in the
state to reject overtime in a bid to get industry to employ
more workers.
    The Daimler spokesman said the lack of overtime work at the
Unterturkheim plant could eventually affect car output at other
plants but added he was unable to say when this might occur.
    A spokesman for Dr.-Ing. H.C. F. Porsche AG [PSHG.F], which
is also located in Baden-Wuerttemberg, said he did not think
Porsche would suffer any loss of production because of a ban on
overtime by its own works councils.
    A strike by IG Metall in Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1984 closed
down the German car industry for about seven weeks as the union
sought to win a 35-hour working week for its members. It later
settled for a reduction in the working week to 38.5 hours.
    The spokesman said Daimler's total output of cars was
currently around 2,500 a day.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
    Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
16 billion marks from the system.
    The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
close banks here this afternoon.
    Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
needs at the tender.
    Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
    But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
    "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.
    "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
need is clearer," he added.
    An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
    Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
    Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
yesterday.

<TEXT>&#2;
<TITLE>GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    KIEL, West Germany, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The outlook for the West
German economy is relatively bright, with gross national
product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel
University's Institute for World Economy said.
    The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading
economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic
than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently
reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.
    In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export
outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's
strength against the dollar and other major currencies.
    "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in
all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise
in exports can be expected."
    The institute said past experience has shown West German
exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by
cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting
their product ranges.
    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in
economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the
decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow
this year.
    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed
advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both
of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary
policy, the institute said.
    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight
improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire
additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by
agreed reductions in working hours.
    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of
monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked
acceleration of inflation.
    It also warned that what it called the worldwide
synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new
global recession. It said central banks in industrialized
countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal
Reserve Board's expansionary course.
    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead
eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.
Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks
were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could
aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as
increase protectionism around the world.
    Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the
negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary
policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of
growth at home.
    The institute said this could be done by ensuring that
fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes
should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and
wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than
in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary
pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply
to about four pct.

<TITLE>GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The cost of living in West Germany will
likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986,
when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in
the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the
HWWA economic research institute said.
    The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the
fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986
cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the
value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.
    The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the
course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a
whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the
first part of 1987.
    Provisional inflation figures for February released last
week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower
than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct
against the same month a year earlier.
    The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain
around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17
dlrs per barrel.

<TITLE>BUNDESBANK CHANGES REPURCHASE PACT SYSTEM</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Jonathan Lynn, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bundesbank is planning changes in
the system by which banks bid for funds in securities
repurchase pacts to improve the flexibility of its key open
market instrument, central bank officials said.
    Banking economists said the changes will shorten the tender
process to two days from three currently, enabling the
Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts of shorter maturity if it
chooses, to steer money market liquidity more flexibly.
    The changes will probably come into force in April.
    Under the current system, banks must themselves specify at
the tender which securities they will sell to the Bundesbank
for subsequent repurchase, a time consuming business.
    Banks hold securities for this purpose in safe custody
accounts in the Landeszentralbank (LZB) regional central banks,
which are the local offices of the Bundesbank at state level.
    Some 50 billion marks of securities are held in such
accounts at the Hesse LZB, which covers the Frankfurt area.
    The change to come into force next month will allow the
Bundesbank access to these accounts to select the bonds itself,
in a process legally comparable to direct debiting.
    At present the Bundesbank generally announces a tender on
Monday, holds the tender late on Tuesday morning, announces the
result early Tuesday afternoon and allocates funds Wednesday.
    The Bundesbank generally sets repurchase pacts running 28
days. But sometimes public holidays result in longer pacts or
longer tender periods being necessary.
    For instance the Bundesbank announced a tender last Friday
to be held today (Wednesday) for crediting funds tomorrow
(Thursday). The advance announcement took into account the
carnival holiday in Duesseldorf on Monday and in Frankfurt
yesterday (Tuesday).
    Central bank officials and money market dealers said the
shortening of the tender process should be seen as purely
technical, with no direct implications for interest rates.
    "It is not a credit policy matter but a technical matter,"
said an official at the Hesse LZB.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said last December
that security repurchase pacts had proved a much greater
success since their introduction in their present form two
years ago, and praised their flexibility.
    The tender process changes will make the repurchase pact
instrument even more flexible, banking economists said.
    By speeding up the tender process, they will make it
possible for the Bundesbank to offer repurchase pacts for
periods of less than a month, something long sought by banks,
to respond to changing money market conditions.
    "With the help of this instrument liquidity steering will be
refined, but there won't be any effect on interest rates," said
Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann
Remsperger.
    The Bundesbank would be able to react more quickly to money
market developments, but by steering liquidity, not interest
rates, he said.

<TITLE>VEREINS- UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 4 - Vereins- </DATELINE><BODY>und Westbank AG &lt;VHBG.F> plans
to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of
financial services, management board member Eberhard-Rainer
Luckey said.
    He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in
Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed, a
branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
opening a branch in London.
    Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
    The group balance sheet, including for the first time
VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
billion marks, Luckey said.
    The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
while loans to companies rose seven pct.
    Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
account contributed to record operating profits.
    Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
156.7 mln, Luckey said.
    Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in
West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.
    The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct
of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.
    The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986,
and will also continue to stock up risk provisions, he said.

<TITLE>GERMAN ENGINEERS WILL HOLD WARNING STRIKES MARCH 9</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>West German engineering union IG
Metall will hold nationwide warning strikes on March 9, to
press demands for a 35-hour week and a five pct wage increase,
a union spokeswoman said.
    Further details of the time and place of the strikes will
be given at a press conference on the same day, she added.
    In mid-February, IG Metall chairman Franz Steinkuehler
called for the strikes after 35 unsuccessful rounds of talks.
    IG Metall shut down the entire auto industry for seven
weeks in summer 1984 to press employers to cut the working week
to 35 hours from 40. A compromise of 38.5 hours was agreed.

<TITLE>OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    HAMBURG, March 3 - </DATELINE><BODY>Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are
probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October
1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.
    Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut
to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with
10.6 mln a year earlier.
    Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun,
rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and
castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil,
lard and tallow/greases.
    Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production
increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987,
compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the
previous two seasons.
    It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually
low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand
for both food and non-food purposes, it said.
    World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln
tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher
if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic
demand.
    Oil World said it did not expect the European Community
(EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were
introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.

<TITLE>GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Alice Ratcliffe, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 9 - </DATELINE><BODY>Increased federal government borrowing
needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy
mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds
higher this year, bond market sources say.
    "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term
rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly
on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities
investment house in Frankfurt said.
    The sources also said the government had already stepped up
its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.
    Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the
sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six
pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.
    This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct
coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.
    But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract
foreign investors, and the federal government would have to
push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.
    Sources noted federal government issues had also increased
in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume
only starting last May.
    One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's
just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added
conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly
favourable for raising new debt.
    Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad,
with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.
    With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however,
foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as
hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.
    Sources said the government has may have already stepped up
its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.
    The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in
1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing
through bonds was 26.6 billion.
    The sources said this indicated a move by the government
out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds
through the more acceptable loan stock form.
    Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large
amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including
the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce
income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the
portfolio manager said.
    He added that the government's cut in its top income tax
rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for
the government to reduce borrowings.
    The sources said the government would fall far short of
covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the
tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to
fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.
    The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal
government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen
back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the
issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.
    A finance ministry economist said the government did not
expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a
net 22.3 billion marks this year.
    Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would
probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come
into effect.
    "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would
mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.
    Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with
the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation
falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.
    But sources said foreign demand for the new federal
government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the
dollar may now rise against the mark.
    "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in
London said.
    The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark
even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds
recently, some dealers said.

<TITLE>GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    BONN, March 7 - </DATELINE><BODY>Senior officials in the West German
coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would
be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made
by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's
international monetary conference in Paris.
    Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social
Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also
attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and
Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion
mark reduction would represent net tax relief.
    An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.
    The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts
already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.
    Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief
would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal
increase in income tax.
    An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers
1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose
children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the
tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by
increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and
medium-sized companies.
    The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of
a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect
in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this
reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would
be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.
    The West German government had come under pressure from the
United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But
Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while
the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of
growth was uncertain.
    The government said in January it was aiming for real
growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some
economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.
    Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion.
Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe,
or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to
three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few
days ago, remains open at the moment."

<TITLE>GERMAN SECURITIES PURCHASES SET RECORD IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    FRANKFURT, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>Purchases of West German bonds in
January reached a record 13 billion marks' worth as a result of
investment from other European countries amid expectations of a
European Monetary System realignment, the Bundesbank said.
    This produced a surplus in the securities item of the
long-term capital account of 11.17 billion marks and was the
primary contributor to a 10.15 billion surplus in the total
capital account, turning round December's 6.48 billion deficit.
    In January last year, the capital account, combining long
and short-term flows, showed a surplus of 2.27 billion marks,
the Bundesbank said.
    The Bundesbank said foreign purchase of German shares in
January was, by contrast to the massive bond investments, only
about 200 mln marks worth, while overseas purchases of
"Schuldschein" promissory notes fell by 500 mln from December.
    The long-term account in total showed a surplus of 11.17
billion marks, reversing the 2.60 billion deficit in December
and up from a surplus of 9.37 billion in January, 1986.
    Among other items, direct domestic investment abroad posted
an outflow of 2.86 billion marks after a deficit of 4.98
billion in December and a surplus of 1.13 billion in January
last year.
    The Bundesbank confirmed earlier figures from the federal
statistics office that the current account surplus in January
fell to 4.86 billion marks from 8.47 billion last year.
    The trade surplus in the month was down to 7.20 billion
from 11.57 billion in December.
    In the invisibles account, the surplus on services was 100
mln marks, turning round a deficit of 500 mln marks in
December. The balance on payments transfers narrowed to a
deficit of 2.40 billion marks from 2.70 billion.

water remain in force on parts of the West German stretch of
the Rhine river between the Dutch border and the city of Mainz
but most are expected to be lifted this weekend.
    water authority officials said The restrictions, caused by
high water levels, include speed limits and directives to keep
to the middle of the river to prevent damage to the river
banks. The high water was expected to recede within two days to
below levels at which the restrictions come into force.
    Traffic was halted briefly late Tuesday night, Wednesday
and parts of Thursday on stretches of the Rhine between Bonn
and Koblenz but the shipping bans were lifted, the officials
said. Shipping is now permitted on all parts of the West German
section of the Rhine, with restrictions in some areas.

60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the
highest level since 1972, trade sources said.
    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net
imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.
    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a
high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The
sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.
    South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West
German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 -
182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.
    The two South American countries' share of the West German
market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from
Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.
    West Germany imported 56,823 tonnes of fishmeal in
December, up from 46,236 tonnes in the same 1985 month, with
re-exports at 22,262 tonnes after 25,062 a year earlier.

<TITLE>VW EXPECTS FURTHER FALL IN U.S. SALES IN 1987</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    WOLFSBURG, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F> expects
currency factors to cause a further drop in its U.S. Sales in
1987 following a 5.2 pct sales decline in the United States in
1986, board member Karl-Heinz Briam said.
    Briam, who described the current situation of the U.S.
Market as critical, also said VW was uncertain whether it would
be able in 1987 to fully match its record 1986 European sales.
    In 1986 the VW group, which includes Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>,
delivered a record 981,000 vehicles to European markets outside
of West Germany, a rise of 5.1 pct against 1985, Briam told a
regular quarterly meeting of the Wolfsburg plant's workforce.
    Briam said sales conditions in Europe had generally become
more difficult in 1987 because of weaker growth rates and
fiercer competition in the region.
    Briam gave no forecast for VW domestic sales. But he said
car sales in West Germany for all manufacturers combined would
probably fall by a slight three to four pct from 1986's record
2.73 mln because car sales in West Germany had likely passed
their peak for this business cycle.
    Summing up his predictions, Briam said limits to growth
were becoming apparent on the VW group's most important markets
but there were no grounds for great worries.
    The automobile industry, as far as VW was concerned, had
entered its fourth consecutive good year, with VW's incoming
orders and sales remaining favourable overall, he said.
    Briam, who is VW's director of labour relations, also said
VW currently had no plans for further increases in its
workforce.
    He told the plant's workforce that an
internationally-active company like VW must be able to adjust
to changed economic conditions and manage situations in which
unfavourable currency relations restrict its room for financial
maneuver.
    Briam said VW needed to hold and expand market share in
order to overcome its cost disadvantages compared with some of
its foreign competitors, particularly those in the Far East.
    This could only be done if capital-intensive plants were
used as fully as possible, if the workers' qualifications were
raised through comprehensive training and if working hours were
arranged so that expensive production plants operated as
efficiently and soundly as possible.
    The metalworkers union IG Metall has said it plans to push
for a 35-hour working week in its sector of West Germany
industry this year.
    Walter Hiller, the chairman of VW's works council, told the
same Wolfsburg meeting that a cut in the working week to 35
hours was necessary to help reduce unemployment.
    He said the works council was prepared to negotiate on
making working hours more flexible to suit the needs of both
the company and the workforce.
    A seven-week strike by IG Metall in the summer of 1984 for
a 35-hour week in the West German metal industry ended in a
compromise that cut hours to 38.5 hours but also allowed each
company in the industry to decide, in consultation with the
workforce, how the reductions should be made.

    According to the text of a speech made in the town of

benefit from more stable prices. He said he had rejected the
agreement because he preferred there to be no change in the
EC's system of intervention. However, an objective analysis of
the accord showed it contained positive elements, he said.
    No formal vote was taken on the EC accord, but a spokesman

Ireland and Luxembourg were also opposed.

where employers and union representatives met for talks on a
collective wage agreement for 300,000 engineering workers in
the Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony areas.
    IG Metall members began a series of nationwide warning
strikes this week as part of the union's bid to raise wages by
five pct and cut the working week to 35 hours from 38.5 hours.
    Warning strikes held so far this week have generally lasted
about one hour each.
    Employers in northern German offered IG Metall a 2.7 pct
rise in wages from April 1 and a further 1.5 pct from July next
year. It also offered to cut the working week by half an hour
from July 1988.
    IG Metall rejected the offer, and further talks for
northern Germany were later scheduled for March 23.
    On Monday employers in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
offered workers there a similar package of wage rises and
shorter working hours.

<TITLE>BALLADUR EXPECTS IMPROVED FEBRUARY INFLATION DATA</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French inflation rate is expected to
show a substantial improvement in February after January's very
high 0.9 pct monthly rate, Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
said.
    He told a French television interviewer that half of the
high January rise, which took year on year inflation that month
to three pct, was due to higher oil prices.
    "Now, taking account of this inflation index, our forecast
for price rises this year is two and a half pct," he said.
    Balladur said the upward revision of the inflation target,
which the government had initially set at two pct for this
year, should not affect wage expectations for this year.
    "There is no reason to envisage a change in our wage policy,"
he said, referring to the government's aim of holding public
sector wage increases to three pct this year.
    Price inflation last year fell to 2.1 pct from 4.7 pct in
1985.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 2 - </DATELINE><BODY>French state-owned chemicals group
Rhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA> said it will increase its capital with
a 2.5 billion franc issue of preferential investment
certificates on March 9.
    Company chairman Jean-Rene Fourtou said 500 mln francs of
the issue will be placed in the U.S. Details of the issue will
be announced by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur on March 6.
    The group, due to be privatised at an unspecified date,
said in January it was planning a capital increase to pursue
its development strategy and make further acquisitions.
    Rhone-Poulenc shares were suspended from trading on the
Paris Bourse last Thursday ahead of the capital increase. The
group's capital currently stands at 4.03 billion francs.
    Fourtou, speaking at a news conference, did not give
details of acquisitions the company planned for 1987.
    He said acquisitions in 1987 would complement an industrial
investment program of around five billion francs, and research
spending of about 3.5 billion francs. Rhone-Poulenc spent 5.5
billion francs on acquisitions last year.
    "Chemistry is on the move and we face opportunities that
must be seized," Fourtou said.

<TITLE>FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Bank of France is likely to cut its
money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
    The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
of turbulence.
    The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
where it has now stabilised.
    Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
    While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
    The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
    The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
using the intervention rate to set the floor.
    Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
   A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
    They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
scope for a small fall in rates.
    M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

<TITLE>INTERNATIONAL BORROWING REACHES RECORD IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Record high borrowing of 376 billion dlrs
in 1986 on international capital markets was supported by a
large volume of debt refinancing and growing integration
between national and international markets, the OECD said.
    The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) said in its latest Financial Market Trends report the 34
pct rise over 1985 volume was accompanied by major changes in
the relative importance of the instruments used in
international financing.
    Straight bond offerings, equity related securities and
euro-commercial paper programmes as a share in total financing
rose to their highest level this decade. The markets for
floating-rate notes and for note issuance facilities declined.
    The OECD said another striking feature of international
capital markets in 1986 was the unprecedented concentration of
lending to the OECD group of western industrialised countries,
which accounted for 90 pct of total borrowing.
    Factors behind the heightened pace of activity included a
notable decline in interest rates which boosted borrowing
through the flotation of fixed-interest securities.
    This in turn was stimulated by growing familiarity with new
techniques such as interest rate and currency swaps.
    Stockmarket buoyancy supported the expansion of
equity-related bond issues and favoured the expansion of a
rapidly expanding market for euro-equities.
    A slowdown in net demand for funds by sovereign borrowers
was more than offset by a large volume of refinancing
operations induced by improved market conditions and stronger
debt management policies. Growing integration with national
markets meant the arrival of a large number of new players on
international markets.
    It added the development of a smoothly-functioning market
for short-term euro-notes made committee and non-underwritten
issuance facilities an increasingly popular alternative to
traditional forms of bank lending.
    Turning to 1987, the OECD pointed to indications of a
possible slowdown of international markets' expansion and
possibly less easy borrowing terms in a number of market areas.
    It said many market participants saw little scope for a
further decline in long-term rates and anticipate a slowdown in
the pace of fixed-rate activity in the months ahead.
    It saw little reason for a turnaround in the decline in
demand of recent years, although it was likely more borrowers
would try to make use of cost-reducing opportunities provided
by the market for euro-commercial paper.
    "It remains to be seen however to what extent the ECP market
will be ready to absorb a significant volume of paper from
lower-rated borrowers," the report said, adding that any major
advance in the euro-note market's absorptive capacity would
require a significantly broader investor base.

<TITLE>ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 4 - </DATELINE><BODY>The size of French 1986/87 carryover
barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with
700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals
Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.
    He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the
end of February from the previous month while export forecasts
were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86.
    Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a
larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are
opened for French barley a large amount could be put into
intervention.
    A small amount of French barley has already been put into
intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.
    The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports
to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000
tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in
1985/86.
    The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision
to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said.

<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The government plans to go ahead with a
three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed,
with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to
everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.
    At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln
jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive
unemployment benefit.
    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television
interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in
a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the
right to social benefits."
    The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment
through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5
billion franc government fund set up last month to finance
spending on special areas of concern.
    Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers
hit by European Community cost-cutting measures.
    French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8
mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in
1981.

<TITLE>GATT STUDYING AGRICULTURAL SUBSIDIES CEILING</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The world trade body GATT said its
negotiators in Geneva are discussing a possible agreement for a
ceiling on agricultural subsidies.
    GATT director-general for agriculture Jean-Marc Lucq told
reporters here that the talks had not got anywhere yet as the
participants were still reluctant to lay all their cards on the
table.
    He said the ceilings under discussion would only be applied
to those members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
with high subsidy spending.
    Lucq said a survey by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development showed that its 24 member western
industrialised countries subsidised their agriculture by a
total average of more than 100 billion dlrs a year from
1979-81.
    Within that total, the U.S. Spent 26 billion dlrs, Japan 24
billion, and the European Community 57 billion dlrs.
    Yves Berthelot, an official for the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development, said the suppression of
agricultural subsidies in temperate countries, which would
allow a resurgence of world prices and a lowering of domestic
prices, would be difficult but inevitable.

<TITLE>FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE</TITLE>
<AUTHOR>    By Pierre Suchet, Reuters</AUTHOR>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The French primary bond market is showing
signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy
and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent
interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.
    The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal
to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by
announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which
has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day
repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.
    The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate,
the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which
reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this
week, dealers noted.
    The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the
money markets since December has been based on a floor and
ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and
seven day repurchase rates.
    For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate
cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among
market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.
    Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond
market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of
11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily
absorbed.
    The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12
billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as
much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing
needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.
    Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity
in the primary market at the moment despite competition from
the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.
    There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with
formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand
- with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which
have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.
    Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement
des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc
bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued
over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March
9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.
    Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since
the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.
    Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms
of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest
focussed on the likely three next issues.
    These will include an expected four to five billion franc
issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of
around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a
subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a
new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de
Refinancement Hypothecaire.

<TITLE>FRANCE SETS PRICE FOR RHONE-POULENC ISSUE</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 6 - </DATELINE><BODY>The Finance Ministry said it set a price
of 335 francs per investment certificate for a public offering
of the state's rights to a 2.5 billion franc one-for-five
rights issue of certificates by Rhone-Poulenc &lt;RHON.PA> opening
Monday.
    The price was based on a 12 billion franc minimum value set
on Rhone-Poulenc by the independent Privatisation Committee
established by the government to oversee its five-year
privatisation programme, the Ministry said.
    A Ministry statement said eight mln privileged investment
certificates, a form of non-voting preference share, would be
issued, equivalent to one certificate for every five existing
shares.
    It said 10 pct of the certificates would be reserved for
Rhone-Poulenc employees at a preferential price, and 1.5 mln
certificates would be placed on the U.S. Market by a public
offering.
    About four mln certificates, the remainder of the state's
rights entitlement to the issue, would be offered on the Paris
Bourse on the basis of 20 francs per lot of five rights and 315
francs per new certificate, making a total 335 francs, it said.
    Rhone-Poulenc is 88.39 pct state-owned.

<TITLE>SHELL FRANCAISE RETURNS TO PROFIT IN 1986</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>Shell Francaise &lt;SFMF.PA>, a subsidiary of
&lt;Shell Petroleum NV>, returned to the black last year for the
first time since 1982, with parent company net profit of 43 mln
francs against losses of 968 mln in 1985 and 1.07 billion in
1984. In 1982 it posted a profit of 329 mln.
    The company said in a statement that cash flow had improved
strongly although it remained negative at 182 mln francs
against 1.34 billion in 1985, due largely to improved
performances by its main profit centres.
    It said the results could have been even better had it not
been for the collapse of refining and sales profit margins in
the last quarter of the year.
    In 1986 Shell sold 14.74 mln tonnes of oil products against
14.52 mln tonnes in 1985.
    The company said the results were in line with its targets
for the second year of its three-year recovery programme.
    Meanwhile, &lt;Societe Shell Chimie) said it also returned to
profit in 1986, for the first time since 1976, posting net
profit of 160 mln francs against a 1985 loss of 57 mln. No
other details were available.

    Speaking to reporters after a shareholders meeting, he said
Eurotunnel would offer "a menu of securities" designed to

<TITLE>FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>French official reserves fell 45.06
billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from
421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
    It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign
currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the
European Monetary System (EMS).
    Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs
during the month, the ministry said.
    This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through
operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund,
counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from
the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held
with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).
    But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc
deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a
result of using very short-term financing instruments.
    The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and
other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange
markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in
an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight
of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the
franc.
    On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against
the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.
    The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves
to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74
billion at end December.
    Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.
    Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion
francs from 75.27 billion at end December.
    Claims on the International Monetary Fund fell 219 mln
francs to 19.31 billion francs.

<TITLE>FRENCH FARMERS STRONGLY CRITICISE EC MILK PACT</TITLE>
<DATELINE>    PARIS, March 5 - </DATELINE><BODY>The EC agriculture ministers' agreement on
reducing dairy output puts milk producers in an impossible
situation, French farm unions said.
    The accord to limit butter sales into intervention, part of
planned dairy output cuts of 9-1/2 pct over two years, will cut
milk producers' income, a spokeswoman for France's largest farm
union, the FNSEA, said.
    The move has destroyed part of the Common Agricultural
Policy, French milk producers said in a press release.
    But Agriculture Minister Francois Guillaume said
repercussions of the plan will affect dairies, not farmers.
    "If there are negative repercussions, it will be at the
level of the dairies which have never looked for new outlets
for butter and milk," he told journalists during a visit to
Rouen.
    FNSEA president Raymond Lacombe said on French radio the
milk sector needs restructuring by encouraging early retirement
and helping young farmers to start. But Commission proposals,
rejected by ministers, would have frozen land prices, he said.
    The FNSEA says it will demonstrate over Commission
proposals to freeze most 1987/88 farm prices and cut supports.
Pig farmers have held violent demonstrations over falling pork
prices and milk producers blocked roads in protest at cuts in
milk output.
